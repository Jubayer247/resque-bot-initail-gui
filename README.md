COMPLETE AND SUSTAINABLE WILDFIRE OUTBREAK PROTECTION AND PREVENTION MODEL APPLYING LATEST TECHNOLOGICAL CONCEPTS

Solution engages people of all stages involved in fire outbreak to provide efficiency and effectiveness that specially covers area from detection smart firefighting, firefighters safety, critical decision making for management level and prevention methods.


This is a project which has four major part to provide a complete fire safety, firefighting, prevention and damage mitigation process well suited for wildfire but can be implemented to any urban, rural and all other possible system on demand without any major changes.

Detection
Create Awareness
Automatic mitigation
Smart Firefighting Agent
Detection is basically done using prediction NASA's previous data that has implemented by us with expected accuracy, remote sensor feed placed in specific distance create a mash network, processed image from live camera feed, social media feed and report through the mobile application. Besides, we have custom designed fire detector wire which is comparatively cheap and affordable initially tested on 2 km range.

Sending Alert to affected people or authority through mobile application and smart IOT based fire alarm where all of the fire alarms in a particular will ring upon receiving data from the provided API. Besides, application will also give alarm without internet while receive SMS from the registered authority number. Moreover, (work fine without any data or network connectivity) in the background the application will send distress signal with Bluetooth beacons. Finally, it has been tested and confirmed with the help cellular network provider if anyone in the affected area will be informed through automated voice call as long as the user is not confirmed they are notified within the incident timeline. List of affected people of affected people will be available to the firefighter teams ,neighbors and emergency contacts during

Advanced Rescue-Bots include 4 robots for different purposes to work as a supporting hand to the firefighter but simple and organized control station, user interface will allow any civilian to operate them in emergency situations.

Controlled from a safe distance from a control station, can be controlled automatically
Automatically shoots fireball to the affected area and also cover a targeted area
Detects fuels like dry leaves , trees and grass ,and also measure air quality
Most sophisticated sensors and powerful mechanical parts, functions in high temperature and customized water-cooling system
Aerial panorama view of the disaster area,
Meaningful sensor data visualization desktop interface also extends to android nearby control station,
On board life detection process and move expected speed uneven surface to be effective in wildlife
Develop low cost human coordinated robot.
Traverse through rubble and surpass obstacles with ease.
Maintain signal strength throughout the time.
Estimate the disaster area condition and environment via different sensors.
Measure physical properties, such as the distance, frequency of sound.
Human Movement Detection
What makes this project special?

We like to focus on the word project in this context, the word system or solution is appropriate in this case as it covers all the essential parts for fire outbreak management if anything appears missing can be extended or customized easily. Specialty of this project includes all four parts are separable easily where different target group can contribute to that part they are interested or has expertise. This is flexible to implement in most of the geographical area without major medication in demand of fire safety.

Future planning and area of concern

We, the Firefly Team would love to work and learn with industry related to this area as we believed we can help each to enrich and grow in many aspects of using the proper strategy and technology. Helps in designing custom parts, robotsâ€™ body, supplying with different required material not found locally which make things leads to slow process, will helps us in greater context. Last not the least, of the monetary cost of some electronic parts and device such as thermal camera become a matter of discouragement as a small to bear all of these. It is also not the case that only the cost, existing products does not meet our requirements and too hard to reproduce. In that case, it will be great to work with the industry to progress together within limited timeline and resources.
